# ACT

### For friends of Advance

This addon is designed for use within your guild. It’s **strongly advised** that **only officers** download ACT directly and then redistribute it **locally** (e.g., via Discord) to the rest of their guild.  
**Why?** Because some small configuration is required for officer access control.

---

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

After installing the addon:

1. Open Nickname.lua
2. Locate the function IsPrivilegedUser() (around **line 124**)
3. Manually input the **BattleTags** of your officers or raid leader

> ⚠️ **Note**: You’ll need to repeat this step **every time** you update the addon through WoWUp.

## 🧩 Addon Modules

You can open ACT using the /ACT command or by clicking the **Advance minimap icon**.

### 📛 Nicknames
Adds nickname support to:
- Default Raid Frames
- Grid2
- Cell
- ElvUI
- SUF
- WeakAura %unit naming
- Liquid's WeakAura packs (natively supported due to collaboration with Liquid devs)
- MRT Note Assignments for the Liquid WeakAura packs or Liquid Timeline Reminder Addon (e.g., if my nickname is set to Isogi but I'm playing Itsmeisogixd, entering Isogi in the MRT note will automatically resolve to my character and give it the relevant assignment or cooldown reminder from Timeline Reminders)
- MRT Raid Cooldown Bars
- ACT Marks module

> **ElvUI Setup**:  
> Raid frames will auto-import nicknames **except** for ElvUI and SUF. You’ll need to manually change your tag options from [name] or [name:...] to one of the following:
> - [nickname]
> - [nickname:short]
> - [nickname:medium]
> 
> How To:  
> /ec → UnitFrames → Individual/Group Units → (Player/Party/Raid1 etc.) → Name

> **SUF Setup**:  
> You’ll need to manually add a tag with the following code:
```
function(unit)
    local name = UnitName(unit)
    return name and LiquidAPI and LiquidAPI:GetName(unit, "SuF") or name
end
```
> How To:  
> /suf → Add Tags → Add New Tag → Name it whatever you want > Drop the above code in the Code box, the Events window will update itself → Save.
> You'll then be able to select the tag in your Unit Configurations 

**Notes:**
- Players that do not have nicknames will automatically return their player character names.
- If you prefer to display player character names on your Raid Frames or MRT Raid Cooldown Bars for characters that do have nicknames simply do /ACT → Nicknames → Untick "Show nicknames on Party/Raid Frames & MRT Raid CDs. All Raid Frames & MRT Raid Cooldown Bars will instead return player names. Unticking this checkbox does not break WeakAuras & (MRT Note) Assignments, they'll continue to resolve nicknames even with this option turned off.

### 🧱 Raid Groups
For easy configuration of your Raid's groups. Simply drag people in, and out of your raid, or just swap their positions in the groups. No longer do you need to drag people in and out of groups to configure your raid frames to look nice. You'll also be able to save or import any preset you'd like for future reference. Sometimes healers just like their frames to look the same every week! If holding Shift when clicking on Import Preset or Delete preset, you will be able to mass import or delete presets. Characters in Group 1 through 6 will have a black background indicating they're in a somewhat correct spot in the raid, if they're in Group 7 or 8, the background will be colored yellow indicating they're in the raid and can be moved to a correct spot, and if the background is red, that character is not in the raid.

---

### 📝 Assignments
You can now use saved Raid Groups, or your current Raid Roster to generate Liquid WeakAura assignments right from inside the addon.

---

### 🖱️ Macros
A collection of commonly used **raid macros**.  
Clicking an icon generates a macro for that specific **world marker** or **icon**.

---

### ❌ Marks 
Set permanent marks on players for assigning them to mechanics or make them more visible. 

---

### 🔀 Split Helper
Helps ensure players are on the correct characters:
- Useful for split raids
- Also helpful for boss-specific setups with frequent swaps

---

### 🧪 Addon Checker
Checks raid members to verify:
- Presence of important raid addons
- Whether those addons are **up-to-date**

---

### 🔁 WeakAura Updater
Allows you to push **WeakAuras** directly to raid members:
- No more relying on Discord messages or manual imports
- Ideal for small auras or individual bosses (e.g., *if you manually updated the Rik Reverb auras from the Liquid package*)

---

### 🔍 Version Checker
Displays:
- Who in the raid has ACT installed
- What version they’re running

## 🧠 Addon Syntax

### 📛 Nicknames

Format:

```
Nickname: Char1, Char2; Nickname: Char3, Char4, Char5
```

- `:` starts a nickname definition and lists the characters it applies to.
- `;` starts a new nickname block.
- The last nickname entry **does not** require a trailing `;`.

**Notes:**
- Officers are encouraged to **push default nicknames** to raiders.
- Duplicate characters are automatically filtered out.
- **Officer defaults take precedence** over user-added nicknames, preventing raiders from disrupting assignments.

---

### 🏚️ Raid Groups

Format:

```
Group1: Char1, Char2, Char3, Char4, Char5; Group2: Char6, Char7 ... 
```

- `:` starts a group definition and lists the characters it applies to.
- `;` starts a new group block.
- The last character entry **does not** require a trailing `;`.

**Notes:**
- Realm Names are required to be added to characters not on your realm as without that Blizzard will not recognize them and not move them in your raid frames (only relevant for importing, the Raid Groups UI will do this for you).
- You can add up to 5 characters in each group, with support for up to 8 groups.
- Importing groups are required in order. E.g. you can not import a string with Group 2 only, as it requires Group 1 first. There's helpful error messages that'll guide you when an import is going wrong.

--- 

### ✂️ Split Helper

Format:

```
Char1, Char2, Char3, Char4, ...
```

- Maximum of **30 characters**.
- Going over the limit will result in an error message and abort the import.

---

### 📦 WeakAura Updater

- Use this to send **any WeakAura string**.
- Larger strings (and more players) = longer send time.
- Best used for **smaller auras** or **single-boss setups**.
